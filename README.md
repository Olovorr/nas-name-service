# Universal Name Service for NAS 
Name service for addresses on Nebulas blockchain platform. Unopinionated and easy to use in _any_ scenario.

## Idea

This package contains helper functions that can be used universally for _**each**_ smart contract developer:
- Enables you to store / retrieve any custom data about user that you want (displayName, rating...)
- Share knowledge about users (by their wallet addresses) amongst all the smart contracts
- Get all the users in the smart-contract, i.e. for autosuggestions 
- Search through wallet addresses by any property you want on smart-contract side (if you want to optimize front-end)

#### Motivation

I needed something like this for my dApp (fair-contracts) and I think we should have this universal, easily accessible for everyone, but still with high enough abstraction so it doesn't limit developers. 

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] and should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install --save nas-name-service
```
or

```
yarn add nas-name-service
```

## Usage

TBD
